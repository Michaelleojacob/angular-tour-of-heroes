# angular-tour-of-heroes

key things to note for later

- ng serve --open
  opens localhost and freshes vscode when saving changes.

- ng generate component < compoent name >
  generates a folder with 4 files -> .ts .html .spec . spec.ts
  call without brackets ex -> ng generate component my-component

- ng generate service message
  generates a new service. I think from now on i'll be putting all services in their own folder, for 'Tour of Heroes' I put the services in the app directory, which i'm not a fan of.

- services are like redux
  need to google some more but so far it seems like services act like a reducer of sorts. Then we can get/set using the service(reducer) methods.

- (currently) I do not understand the http and server side of Angular
  I think I just need to get making things and reflect/rely on these docs heavily. good luck future me, may this be of use somehow lol
